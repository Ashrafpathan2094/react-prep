1) Hooks:
Hooks in React are functions that allow you to use state and other React features in functional components. Before hooks, state and lifecycle methods were only available in class components. Hooks enable you to manage state, side effects, context, and more, in a simpler and more reusable way.


    A)      useState: Manages state in functional components.
            useState is a Hook in React that allows you to add state to functional components. It returns an array with two elements: the current state value and a function to update that state. You can initialize the state with a value, and whenever the state changes, React re-renders the component.
            you cant define useState hooks inside if/for or anything, it can only be used on the top lvl of your component

            if you want to use prevstate value when updating new state value
            why this is setCount((prevVal) => prevVal - 1);
            over this setCount(count - 1);

            is because of state updates being asynchronous in React. When you update the state, React may batch updates together, and that can lead to issues if you try to directly use the current state value.

            Why the functional update is preferred:
            State might not update immediately: React batches state updates to optimize performance, which means when you call setCount(count - 1), the count might not be the most up-to-date value, especially if multiple state updates are queued.

            Using prevVal ensures consistency: By passing a function to setCount that gets the previous state value (prevVal), you guarantee that you're working with the most current state, no matter how many updates are queued or batched by React.

            Example:
            Consider this code where we have multiple updates to the state:

            setCount(count - 1);
            setCount(count - 1);
            If count is 4, React might batch both updates and use the same count value for both, resulting in count being set to 3 instead of 2.

            With the functional form:

            setCount((prevVal) => prevVal - 1);
            Each update is based on the most recent state value, so React will correctly calculate and apply the new state for each update.


    B)      useEffect: The useEffect hook in React is used to perform side effects in function components, such as fetching data, subscribing to external services, or directly manipulating the DOM. It runs after the component renders and can be triggered on specific state or prop changes.

            useEffect(() => {
            console.log("resource changed");

            return () => {
            console.log("return from resource change");
            };
            }, [resourceType]);

            In this code, the cleanup function is the function returned inside the useEffect hook. It runs when:

            Before the effect re-runs: If the resourceType dependency changes, the cleanup function from the previous render will run first (before the effect runs again). basically the return runs first if the useEffect has ran once on first render
            On component unmount: When the component is removed from the DOM, the cleanup function runs to perform any necessary cleanup (like cancelling subscriptions or timers).

            
    C)      useContext:The useContext hook in React allows you to access values from a Context without needing to pass props down manually through each component. It helps you share global state, like themes, authentication, or language preferences, across your app.


    D)      useReducer: Manages complex state logic with a reducer function.The useReducer hook is a more advanced way to manage state in React, useful for handling complex state logic or when state changes depend on previous state. It's similar to useState, but instead of setting state directly, it uses dispatching actions to update the state through a reducer function.


    E)      useMemo: The useMemo hook in React is used to memoize the result of an expensive calculation or computation, ensuring that it only re-calculates when its dependencies change. This can help optimize performance by preventing unnecessary recalculations on each render.

    F)      useCallback: The useCallback hook in React is used to memoize a function, ensuring it doesn't get re-created on every render unless its dependencies change. This can help optimize performance, especially when passing functions as props to child components that might re-render unnecessarily.


    G)      useRef: Creates a mutable object that persists between renders.The useRef hook in React is used to create mutable references that persist across renders without causing re-renders. It can be used to access DOM elements or to hold a mutable value that doesnâ€™t trigger a re-render when it changes



2) Higher Order Components (HOC):

            What?
            A Higher-Order Component (HOC) is a function that takes a component as an argument and returns a new component with enhanced or modified behavior.

            When?
            You use HOCs when you want to:

            Reuse component logic: Share common behavior across multiple components without repeating code.
            Manipulate or extend component behavior: Modify the behavior of a component, such as adding additional props, fetching data, or handling side effects.
            Enhance component functionality: Add features like authentication checks, logging, or state management.
            Why?
            HOCs promote:

            Code reusability: The same logic can be reused across different components.
            Separation of concerns: Business logic and UI logic can be separated. HOCs focus on logic, while components focus on rendering.
            Enhancement of components: HOCs allow you to augment components with new capabilities without altering their original code.
            How?
            To create an HOC, you:
            Write a function that accepts a component.
            The function returns a new component that wraps the original component and adds additional functionality, such as modifying props, state, or behavior.



3) Life Cycle Methods of Components:
            Summary of Key Life Cycle Methods:
            Phase	    Method	                        Purpose
            Mounting	
                        constructor()	                Initialize state and bind methods.
                        getDerivedStateFromProps()	    Update state based on props changes.
                        render()	                    Return JSX to render the component.
                        componentDidMount()         	Perform side effects like fetching data or DOM manipulations.
            Updating	
                        getDerivedStateFromProps()	    Update state based on props during updates.
                        shouldComponentUpdate()	        Optimize re-renders by determining if the component should update.
                        render()	                    Re-render the component with updated state or props.
                        getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()	    Read values from the DOM before updates.
                        componentDidUpdate()	        Perform side effects after the update.
            Unmounting	
                        componentWillUnmount()	        Clean up before the component is removed.

            When to Use Each Method:
            Mounting methods are used when you need to initialize state or set up something once when the component first renders.
            Updating methods are helpful when your component needs to react to changes in props or state, or optimize performance (e.g., using shouldComponentUpdate).
            Unmounting method is used to clean up resources, like cancelling API requests, removing event listeners, or clearing timers, when the component is removed.
            This structure makes it possible to control different stages of a component's lifecycle, allowing you to perform specific actions when necessary.

4) State management (all about data):
State/Props: Internal state for a component/external data passed to a component.
Props drilling: Passing props through multiple layers of components.
Context: Provides a way to pass data through the component tree without passing props.

5)Global State Management
LocalStorage

Redux or Zustand:
How redux works?: Centralized state management using actions and reducers.
Why?: For managing complex application states.
When?: In large applications with a need for a single source of truth.
Redux Toolkit (RTK): Simplifies Redux setup and usage.

6) Custom Hooks:

What are Custom Hooks in React?
Custom hooks in React are JavaScript functions that allow you to extract and reuse stateful logic across multiple components. They are simply functions that use React hooks (useState, useEffect, etc.) and can be shared across your app to avoid code duplication.

Why Use Custom Hooks?
Reusability: They allow you to extract logic that can be reused in multiple components, reducing redundancy.
Separation of Concerns: They help you organize complex logic outside of your components, making the components easier to read and maintain.
Clean Code: Custom hooks help you write cleaner code by abstracting away non-UI logic into a separate function.

When to Use Custom Hooks?
When you have shared logic: If multiple components need to use the same functionality (e.g., form handling, fetching data, managing timers), create a custom hook to avoid repeating code.
When your component is too complex: If a component is becoming large due to managing complex logic, move that logic into a custom hook to keep the component clean and focused on rendering.
For better code organization: As your app grows, custom hooks help you maintain a modular codebase by keeping related logic together.


7) Lazy Loading:
Code splitting: Breaking down the application into smaller parts.
Chunking: Loading only the necessary code chunks.
Suspense: Pausing rendering until a component is ready.

Lazy loading is the practice of loading a component or resource only when it is needed (e.g., when it's about to be displayed on the screen). This reduces the initial load time by deferring loading until necessary.
In React, React.lazy() is used to dynamically load components only when they are needed.


Path-Based Lazy Loading in React:

Path-based lazy loading is a more advanced form of lazy loading where routes are lazily loaded based on the path or route. This is useful when working with React Router, as each route can dynamically load its components as the user navigates.



8) Virtual DOM vs DOM:
Reconciliation Algorithm: Efficiently updates the UI based on state changes.
React Fiber: A reimplementation of React's core algorithm.
Renders: The process of updating the virtual DOM.
Diff algorithm: Compares the previous and current state to determine changes.
How does render work?: Updating the UI based on virtual DOM changes.

9) SSR vs CSR (important):
What?: Server-Side Rendering vs. Client-Side Rendering.
Difference: Where rendering occurs - server or client.
SEO and performance (SSR): Improved search engine optimization and initial load speed.

10) Routing (Role-based access control-RBAC):
react-router: Library for handling navigation in React applications.
How do you manage protected routes?: Utilize authentication and authorization checks.
How do you handle routes?: Define routes and components for navigation.
Query params: Additional information passed in the URL.
Dynamic routing: Creating routes dynamically based on data.

11) Testing:
React Testing Library: Testing library for React applications.
Unit Testing: Testing individual units of code.
Hack for interview: Emphasize writing testable code and demonstrate test cases.
